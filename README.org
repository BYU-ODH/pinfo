* PInfo
A simple service to utilize BYU's web services to return personid, netid, and a few other sundry pieces of information that can be used to get information necessary for more advanced API requests. 

** Prerequisites
You will need [[https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen][Leiningen]] 2.0.0 or above installed.

Prior to deploying you will need to modify =src/pinfo/sample-config.clj= to a matching =config.clj= in order to run, including the information for your application authorization you've received from https://api.byu.edu/store .

** Running
To start a web server for the application from the codebase, run:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
    lein ring server
#+END_SRC

** Deployment
Deploying to Wildfly is accomplished by producing an immutant war and then dropping it into the appropriate standalone directory of your Wildfly server. 

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
lein immutant war; scp target/pinfo.war user@server:<wildfly-deployment-path>
#+END_SRC
